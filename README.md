# MCP Integration Demo

This project serves as a demonstration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MCP enables advanced AI agents to interact with code, files, and development environments in a seamless and context-aware manner.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to showcase how MCP can be used to:
- Access and manipulate project files programmatically
- Provide intelligent code assistance
- Automate development workflows
- Enhance productivity with AI-driven context awareness

## Features
- AI-powered code editing and navigation
- Contextual understanding of project structure
- Automated file and directory management
- Integration with version control systems

## Usage
This repository is intended for demonstration and experimentation with MCP-enabled agents. You can use it to:
- Test MCP agent capabilities
- Explore AI-driven development workflows
- Build and extend MCP-based tools

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up your MCP-enabled agent or environment.
3. Interact with the project using the agent to experience MCP features.
